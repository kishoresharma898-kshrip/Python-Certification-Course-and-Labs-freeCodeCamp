'''Write a function that calculates the final price of an item after applying a percentage discount.

For example, if the price of an item is 50 and a discount of 20 is applied, the discount amount is 10, and the final price is 40.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should define a function named apply_discount.

The apply_discount function should take exactly two parameters: price and discount.

If price is not a number (int or float), the function should return the string The price should be a number.

If discount is not a number (int or float), the function should return the string The discount should be a number.

If price is less than or equal to 0, the function should return the string The price should be greater than 0.

If discount is less than 0 or greater than 100, the function should return the string The discount should be between 0 and 100.

If both inputs are valid, the function should calculate the discount as a percentage of the price.

The function should return the final price after applying the discount.

    elif discount < 0 or discount > 100:
        return "The discount should be between 0 and 100"
    else:
        final_price = price - (price * (discount/100))
        return round(final_price, 2)

# Test results:
print(apply_discount(100, 20)) # 80
print(apply_discount(200, 50)) # 100
print(apply_discount(50, 0)) # 50
print(apply_discount(50, 100)) # 0
print(apply_discount(74.5, 20.0)) # 59.6
print(apply_discount(-50, 0)) # The price should be greater than 0
print(apply_discount(83, 101)) # The discount should be between 0 and 100
print(apply_discount("50", 50)) # The price should be a number
print(apply_discount(50, "101")) # The discount should be a number
print(apply_discount("501", "101")) # The price should be number
